# JavaScript target for ANTLR 4

JavaScript runtime libraries for ANTLR 4

This runtime is a small modification of the original ANTLR 4 JavaScript runtime that avoids patching ``String.prototype.hashCode``.

This runtime has been tested in Node.js, Safari, Firefox, Chrome and IE.

See www.antlr.org for more information on ANTLR

See https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/javascript-target.md for more information on using ANTLR in JavaScript
